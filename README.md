# Relational Network
Pytorch implementation for [A Simple Neural Network Module for Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf).

Work under progress.

Part of the network module code adopted from:
https://github.com/kimhc6028/relational-networks

## How to run the code
Step 1: Download the CLEVR_v1.0 dataset
Step 2: Point to that location in the `datasets.py` file
Step 3: Run `datasets.py` file which will create a directory structure as mentioned in the file itsef.
Step 4: Run `python trainer.py`
